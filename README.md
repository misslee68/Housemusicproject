This is my favorite style of music
Lisa,

I like your use of comments throughout to show the different sections. Good work also with your divs and keeping everything in the sections they need to be. You used the forms and tables well and I like how you added in the YouTube videos into the second table. Good use of style throughout to have different colors and styles. It is really cool how your Mixes and My Picks links take you to the different sections on the page, as well as the Blog and Download access links take you externally. 

One suggestion is working on setting your code up a little cleaner so that is more easily readable line by line.
